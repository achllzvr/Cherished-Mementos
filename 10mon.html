                        Finally had somewhat of a clear mind and space to make a letter. I wanted to have a (somewhat of a*) clear mind while I create this monthâ€™s letter so I can better word out what my heart wants to say for now hehe.
                        <br><br><br>
                        To my Mareese,
                        <br><br><br>
                        Youâ€™re big na. ðŸ¥¹
                        <br><br><br>
                        Youâ€™ve been a very good and very fast learner on a lot of things throughout your summer break. Driving, patience, mothering, somewhat being independent sometimes. Youâ€™ve become stronger and more just. You became stronger on all aspects. Physically stronger and better at holding on, keeping things together and being faster than before. More emotionally wise (?) and aware and you mostly know your way around things and feelings now even more. More mentally prepared and strong, you know that and you saw that yourself.
                        <br><br><br>
                        I am very proud of you, my love. Thank you for growing and thank you for choosing to grow with me. Please know na I see and feel you growth. Alongside that, always remember that trying and failing is always better than not doing anything at all. That saying will surely go a long way. I see and appreciate your attempts, both the almost successful ones and the successful ones. Letâ€™s continue to grow and continue to try to be a better version of ourselves for each other, love. Mwah
                        <br><br><br>
                        Iâ€™m sorry for how Iâ€™ve been acting recently, both on myself and to everyone around me, especially you. I promise Iâ€™m trying my best to hold on to what remains of myself and everything in my life that is worth holding onto. Iâ€™m trying my best to try and do what I can with what Iâ€™ve been given everyday. I promise to continue and Iâ€™ll always be with you as much as I can in the ways that I can.
                        <br><br><br>
                        For what lies ahead, to the unknown, our college lives and what lies ahead for our personal and academic life, letâ€™s paubaya it na to God and letâ€™s live life and study well while doing so because Iâ€™m sure He will give us what we deserve based on what we do for us, ourselves, and Him. And to the known, well, on my end, all ik is that Iâ€™ll love you for the rest of my life ðŸ˜š and Iâ€™m sure, yes sure, really sure, very really sure, always have been sure, na itâ€™s you who I want to spend the rest of my known and unknown life with.
                        <br><br><br>
                        <br><br><br>
                        Thank you for everything, my love. The patience you give, the care you make me feel, the efforts you exert, the money you spend and spoil, and many more hard to specify and explain things. Thank you, love. You and everything you, is always appreciated.
                        <br><br><br>
                        I love you so much, my Mareese. My pretty baby. My alonica.
                        <br><br><br>
                        Youâ€™ve always been more than enough, baby. You always have been.
                        <br><br><br>
                        I love you, always and forever, my pretty baby, Mareese. Mwahh.
                        <br><br><br>
                        Your pretty boy is and will always be waiting for you.
                        <br><br><br>
                        Good luck and Iâ€™ll be with you in this new incoming life ahead of you and Iâ€™ll help you and guide you along the way. Always. Mwah.
