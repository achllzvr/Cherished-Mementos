                        <br>
                        You fell asleep tonight hehe. Hi, love. I‚Äôm writing this letter with the darkness ng entire house trying to accompany me kasi I‚Äôm sleeping in the couch. I‚Äôve always been alone, and yk that. Growing up, I never really had anyone to show me the love I wanted. Kim and I grew up together pero of course, that‚Äôs a different kind of love. I had my fair share of heartbreaks and tough times, most notable ones are the pandemic hardships I faced and the hardships I faced trying to find someone. <br>
                        <br>
                        Around late June-July, I started conditioning myself to realize na I‚Äôm okay with growing up alone. Just me and my job, cars, house, properties, whatever I want. And then you came alone and changed the game. You out of nowhere started to show me as a friend how great of a person you are and I started realizing na there is hope in humanity with you and your energy. Your arrival in my life was very unexpected, maybe mine was unexpected din sayo, pero ofc, it was very much welcomed. <br>
                        <br>
                        You looking out for me from the time I was sick made me realize na even though others checked up one me (parents ko langüòî), yours was different somehow. I honestly don‚Äôt know how to say it pero your genuine and thoughtful and caring energy during my sick days was something I didn‚Äôt expect I needed. I don‚Äôt know if I properly expressed my thanks before pero this is me doing it hehe. Thank you for caring for me back then, love; It was something I really needed during the time and I appreciate what you did, so much. <br>
                        <br>
                        Ofcourse I have to mention here your persistence on inviting me sa birthday mo despite me just being a normal everyday friend back then. I also have to singit my thanks for accompanying me during my study times during that time kahit we were just friends and you had nothing to do pero you still allowed time and effort to accompany me. Maybe you did like me waaaay before na HAHAHA. <br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you sayo and kay Tita for insisting na I hop on sa birthday mo hehe. Who would‚Äôve thought the thrill seeking we did and expected that week were really just for us, not for others HAHAHAHAHAHA. <br>
                        <br>
                        Rosa. Rosa was an unexpected gala for me honestly. I knew we were just friends back then so I knew trying to get you to come with me sa Rosa was something you‚Äôd prolly decline on, pero you didn‚Äôt, and I am glad you didn‚Äôt. Our Rosa trip was something I‚Äôll cherish for a long time not only cus we were with Maki, but also because it was start of ig what we could call ‚Äúthe slow burn‚Äù. That day was the birth of many things. One of which that I can recall was Side Walk and I‚Äôm glad side walk stuck with us, and I hope it will, I know it will. <br>
                        <br>
                        Ah yes, the Exception title. From the start of me getting labeled as the exception, I kinda already felt my level of importance and value sa life mo. I am, til this day, honored of that title you gave me and I appreciate it, so much. <br>
                        <br>
                        I also have to acknowledge you and Tita‚Äôs trust pagdating saakin. With the car and most especially your life and you in general. It baffled and overwhelmed me at first (maybe cus I thought I didn‚Äôt deserve it) pero imma be fr, thank you sainyo and especially sayo for placing a huge amount of trust on me. I know I prolly won‚Äôt pero I hope I don‚Äôt/ won‚Äôt break it in the future. <br>
                        <br>
                        I also have to thank you for supporting me in everything I do and love. From someone who hasn‚Äôt really been acknowledged much by his wants and the things he geeks about, I thank you so much for letting me loose from the prison I enclosed myself on just to cope with the things peeps made me feel about my wants.<br>
                        <br>
                        I thank you rin for being a very kind, gentle, understanding, caring, God-centered, almost disciplined, and loving woman and I am glad you chose me to be your boyfriend.<br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you for contributing greatly to my life within weeks and months lang ng talking and thank you for continuing on pushing me to be a better version of myself everyday and riding along my self-improvement journey.<br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you for accepting me and loving me despite my flaws and weaknesses and my possible frequent short-comings.<br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you so much for spoiling me with gifts, love, AND EVERYTHING NA FROM YOU, LOVE.<br>
                        <br>
                        This is gonna be hard for me for the next monthsaries and anniversaries to top off pero hey, I like challenges. I can‚Äôt promise na every letter ko will be this long, pero I can promise you one thing. I‚Äôll love every second of creating such letters may it be a short or a long letter.<br>
                        <br>
                        I hope I mentioned everything I wanted to say na and didn‚Äôt forget to mention things so far.üò≠<br>
                        <br>
                        Love, thank you for being the break sa curse/ cycle ko, love. My life has just been a never ending loop of luckiness, misery, redemption, repeat. But ever since you arrived, it was just something along luckiness, gratefulness, preservation, repeat. I don‚Äôt know how to properly put it into words cus ik I‚Äôm not good at expressing things pero Love, thank you, so so much. For always being here for me in my brightest days and even during my darkest nights. Thank you, truly.<br>
                        <br>
                        Also, I am glad I‚Äôm the reason and the one who is witnessing your growth as a lover, girlfriend, daughter, friend, classmate, but in a shorter term, a human being. I am proud of you‚Äôre growth so far my love. Can‚Äôt wait to see you grow and improve more and of course, I‚Äôll be joining you on that ride too.<br>
                        <br>
                        I have to mention din na I am sorry din for my shortcomings. I can‚Äôt specifically name them all pero I know I might‚Äôve done some. Please trust me when I say it wasn‚Äôt my intention to hurt you or to fall short and I‚Äôll do my best to be better the next second. I hope you know na my intentions are always for the good and (if applicable) for the betterment of us and our relationship.<br>
                        <br> I know I have issues especially with the other guy peeking out more than usual recently and I have to say thank you for loving me nonetheless and for enduring that depressing side of my life. I hope as time goes on, I will evolve and improve not for myself but for the people around me rin, especially for you, us.<br>
                        <br>
                        You came into my life when I was on my path to ‚Äúself-love‚Äù. I was already on my path on finding my peace despite being alone. And I guess God showed me that my peace was with you all along and not in being alone. Thank you for being my peace, my love. I will forever be thankful kay God for allowing me to express my love and for allowing me to be yours.<br>
                        <br>
                        Life is truly magical. One day I‚Äôm living my usual normal life, the next I‚Äôm chatting with you for chikas, moved on to thrill seeking, proceeded to stage slow burn, realizations, then poof, I found the love of my life. Thank you, Marylle. My life has never been this good and I myself haven‚Äôt felt this great about myself and my life. I thank you so much for everything you poured out so far during our first-ish month. I am very lucky to have a woman like you, no, I am lucky to have you, Marylle. I am lucky to have you in my life and I will forever thank God for giving me the opportunity to love you. Yk how I do with remembering and explaining things. I might‚Äôve forgot a few things I wanted to say pero I think you know naman na I am thankful for everything, and you, most especially you and everything within you.<br>
                        <br>
                        I love you,<br>
