                        I guess alone time and darkness are my trigger points to creating letters huh. Hi, love. I'm writing this by letting my hands just type on their own and letting my heart just type out what it wants to say to you. This time (yesterday) was the time you had your terrible fever thing and it pains me to see you suffer like that especially 'cause I can't do much or contribute anything to make you feel better. I want to say sorry kasi ganito yung sitiuation natin cus of me. I know naman na you understand pero you deserve something better than this sitiuation, you deserve a sitiation wherein I can be there for you when you need me and I'm sorry you have to settle for less with our setup at the moment. This is gonna sound very "Primo" pero he said it well eh haha. I hope you hold on with me lang through this and be with me as we face these unfortunate sitiuations and challenges life can throw at us. Basically be with me in finding the answers to all the "hows" in life. I do hope I'm not falling short on the man I said I'd become. I'm sorry for being an abala tonight. I know you've just recovered and is still recovering so my pagka-crybaby was definitely not much of a help din. I honestly how to eradicate this stupid parasite within me and it kills me knowing na I have this guy because you don't deserve someone with this issue kaya I will try my best to keep him down and be better in the process na rin. I'm really sorry if this looks like an apology letter more than a monthsary letter, I just needed to let the sorrys out. I'm sorry din if it looks like I'm not letting you care for me, trust me I want to and I am letting you naman pero this was just not it and I can't drag you down my hellhole because I don't want you in that dark place rin.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you, love. You've been nothing but understandable, too understandable throughout the course of our 1 (almost 2) month old official relationship. I don't know how to repay or give it back or express my gratitude to you properly. Thank you for understanding and accepting me despite my flaws and the downsides that came with me as the "full package". Thank you for always being there for me when you can. Please know na I know you're always doing your best in everything and that you always do the things you want when you can naman. I appreciate every bit of your existence and I couldn't be more grateful na you're the one God chose to match with me and thank you for allowing me to enter your life. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I know we're young and sOcIeTy might say na "iT's tOo eArLy" to say this pero I'm not leaving you. I won't leave you. I will stick with you. I'll be with you in your brightest days and in your darkest nights. Our current sitiuation has its challenges and hardships sometimes pero I'm willing to go through them if that means I'll be with you til the end. I hope you hold on with me lang and please, please don't leave me :( . No one has ever made me feel what you make me feel. My life ever since you was just a straight rocket to the sky high. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I love you, Marylle. Please don't ever think otherwise. I love you more than myself and I don't care if that sounds bad pero it's true. I love you, my penguin. I'll love you always and forever. Mwah.

                        Ito yung Nov 30 edit HAHAHAHA. Oh wow, gantong oras tayo nang madaling araw naguusap nung July. Anyways, hello hi. I have to drop a few last messages lang before I end this month's letter. With recent happenings like my Sem-break happenings, pag-aalaga sayo during times na may sakit ka, the hospital errand day and beach day, THE LOVEBIRDS happenings, etcetera. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Those events really showed us life if that makes sense. It showed us all the possible sitiuations we may end up on. That includes the highs, lows, calm and peaceful days, the stressful and very tense days, love & pleasure-ful daysüòö, and the importance of controlling ourselves and the way we view life. It made me realize na I enjoyed everything. The highs, lows, calms, stressful, especially the loveful days. And it's all because it was with you. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Before, nung single era ko pa, may thought ako sa brain ko na feel ko di ako makakasurvive sa relationship lalo na on the low/ "boring" days ng relationships. Boom, us happened, you proved me (my thoughts) wrong again. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Solidified even more na it's you na nga. It's you that I want and love. It's you who I want to go through everything with. It's you who I want to spend the rest of my life with. I know na I prolly said these words na some time this week or past few days/ week but I just can't miss the opportunity to put it here rin cus who knows, future wifey (you) and future me and our child( +"ren" daw sabi ni titaüò≠) might read them. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I also have to point out the "way we react" / "controlling ourselves/ reactions" lesson/ talk natin recently. I loved you even more nung times na yun cus it showed na you are open to trying new things with me and learning with me throughout the rest of our lives. Thank you for understanding my "lesson" about how our views and the way we react on things radiate a vibe/ energy that others can take and thank you for radiating positive energy, my protonüòÅ.

                        <br>
