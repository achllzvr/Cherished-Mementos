Hi, love. Alone time nga talaga ang reason kung pano ako makakagawa ng letters for you ig. Anyways,
<br>
<br>
Happy third month, love. Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year.
<br>
<br>
I need to get this off my chest lang. Iâ€™m sorry. I felt it and I continue to feel it and I know for a fact na Iâ€™ve been doing a terrible job at being your boyfriend. I donâ€™t know on which aspect specifically pero I know I am. Iâ€™m really sorry. I hope you know na I am trying my best every time. Like I said from the start and I know by now Iâ€™m asking for too much na pero I hope you continue to be patient with me lang.
<br>
<br>
Thank you rin. Thank you for allowing me to come or more like re-enter into your life. Thank you for always being open and transparent with me. Thank you for being honest every time. Thank you for being patient. Thank you for always spoiling me. Thank you for understanding me even tho too much na sometimes. I can say thank you pa for more things and feelings na youâ€™ve given/ made me feel pero ig ang most important ay thank you for being you. Thank you for being a great and wonderful person with so much depth that stems from a good heart and a kind soul.
<br>
<br>
I keep my words and promises, you know that. And I did promise you the world at this point and I will continue to try to give it to you.
<br>
<br>
I am happy, more than happy actually. Idk how to describe my thoughts pa because Iâ€™m honestly descending into a dark abyss nanaman rn because of being alone but like, yea yun.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for being the best gift I could ever receive for the entirety of my life. 
<br>
<br>
Before you came, I fr really didnâ€™t want anything. And now that you came, I want to have everything, so I can share it with you.
<br>

[January edits] Well, since Iâ€™ve already tinkered with it naman na nang konti this January, might as well dagdag na rin nang "konti." Thank you, love. January 9 ngayon and this is the time na aside from having tons of butterflies, we explored and weâ€™re becoming a more positive and happy us overall and shielding and combatting every form of negativity we could possible contract. Thank you, love. Thank you for promising with me na weâ€™ll always be happy, weâ€™ll always be positive, weâ€™ll keep smiling, and positive and bright-y in general not only for us in our relationship, but also for ourselves. I couldnâ€™t be more proud of us and you, most especially you. 
<br>
<br>
I want you to know that I am proud of you not only in the academic sense, the good person sense, but also in the friend, best friend, girlfriend, mommy, wifey, and my one and only sense. I am proud and I forever will be proud of you and your growth and I want you to know na you are improving and growing. You are indeed getting better in terms of individuality and in terms of you in our relationship.
<br>
<br>
I want you to know din na I am thankful and I will forever be thankful na God chose me to be your boyfriend and that He answered your prayer as well. I canâ€™t properly describe how loud and proud I am that I have you and how much I am very thankful for you and having you and for having the once in a lifetime opportunity to spend the rest of my lifetime with you because I am not going anywhere, itâ€™s gonna be you and me against everything. You are not alone anymore and you wonâ€™t ever be because I am with you and I always will be. You have your kUyA, friend, best-friend, boyfriend, baby, pretty boy, dAdDy, and of course, your one and only, all in one in me.
<br>
<br>
I want you to know that every time I am out, doing something, getting busy, in school, or in any state I am in. Know that you, y o u, you are in my heart and in my mind actively all the time. You entered and you never left. Haha yes, Iâ€™m tryna release my pagka-cannot-contain na rin here sa letter kay medj mahaba ang January edits ko HAHAHAHAHAHA. I love you, my babyyyyyy. I love you, and I always will.
<br>
<br>

<br>
[Non-January edits] I didnâ€™t expect such a turn for the better to happen to me because  y o u  happened at the most unexpected time of my life. From being completely accepting the fact that Iâ€™ll be growing up alone to not being able to see my life without you. 
To my greatest plot twist for 2023 (honestly could be my entire life), I will forever cherish and take care of you and what we have for the rest of my life.
<br>
<br>
More years to come, baby.
Iâ€™ll love you even more this 2023 and as I will for the rest of my life.
<br>
<br>
I love you. I love you with every cell of my body. I love you, my very pretty baby. Mwah.
<br>
<br>
I love you greatly and dearly, my one and only, my pretty baby.
<br>
<br>
â€™Til death do us part.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Your Pretty Boy
