                       I’ve been suffocating us, especially me in our relationship pala
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I was giving too much yata and idk if that was good or bad.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ig it was good but at the same time, it was bad nga cus I was being let down pero it was mostly my fault din for expecting which is wrong in the first place.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        I’m sorry if I was too much to handle and was being less of a decent person to myself and a decent boyfriend to you in the process of loving you.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You’re right about prioritizing “us” and putting “us” in our number 1 priority instead of each other.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Though it hurts, it was good while it lasted and I did feel the love and pagka-priority and I’m glad you took the initiatize to include our own selves in the number one spot instead of just one of us
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you for growing and enlightening me and making me a better person in the process.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I’m proud of you.

                        I will lay back for a while til I can give out na ulit nang ayos but that doesn’t mean I would lessen my actions and initiatives. I’d still make you feel loved and appreciated and respected, it might feel na it’s not as much as before but I promise my love and appreciation for you won’t go down, it never did and never will, I promise.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My love for you will grow alongside us and our relationship.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        and thank you for sticking with me.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I appreciate you a lot, more than you know, most especially now.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        I want you to know na I’ll still do my best in showing my love for you in all the ways I can kahit na I’m laying back and letting you steer our boat for a while.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My only wish is that you keep your words, don’t let me down, and continue sailing with me, with a map or no map, in this sea of uncertainty and beauty.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you for everything.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        and I hope you continue to grow alongside me.

                        <br>
                        while we continue to love and stick with each other.

                        I hope you won’t plan on leaving me and I do hope you don’t let me down or leave me.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I’m sorry if you’re stuck with me pero I can’t lose you, I won’t have sight of my future even more if you do leave because when I said I couldn’t see my future, it was because I am lost, and all I know is that you’re in it and I hope that would be true, for the rest of our lives.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I love you, Marylle. More than you could ever know and more than what I could ever express with every cell of my body.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        Please don’t make me go alone again, it’s both terrifying and depressing.
                        <br>

                        I remembered what you said and I know the reason why we continue to stay even though “it’s easier to leave.” We stay because we know we can get through the obstacle. We stay because we know ourselves and our love for each other is stronger than the hardships we face together. We stay because we chose and continue to choose each other even if it hurts sometimes. Because at the end of the rainbow, we know there’s a pot of gold if that makes sense.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We know that our happier, stronger, more loving selves are waiting at the end of each hardships.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        and we will continue to live on, ‘til death do us part.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        I love you, Marylle. I chose you, and I will continue to choose you. To love you, to talk with you, to do everything with you, to go through everything with you.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am not leaving you.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I meant it when I said you are never gonna be alone.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        so I hope you do mean your words too.
                        <br>

                        Thank you for allowing us to explore each other and exploring along with me, for doing the "jobs", for letting me feel satisfaction, for letting me make you feel satisfied, for sailing with me through everything, for handling me, taking care of me, understanding me, loving me, but what I can say is the most important right now is the way you chose to stay and continue to stay with me.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I love you, Marylle. More than what I could ever know and express.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        From the very bottom of my heart, thank you.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I love you, so so much.
