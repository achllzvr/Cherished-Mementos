                        Hi, babyyy
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        First off, I love you so much
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I want to first acknowledge your  b i g  growth and your improvements that has come up during February. I saw huge amounts of improvements on all of your aspects and  Iâ€™m proud of you, I always have been, and I really am glad na you just keep on making me even more proud of you and Iâ€™m glad din na you keep pushing me and yourself din in all the ways we possibly can.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        No words could properly describe my gratitude and happiness for you talaga. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Iâ€™m aware havenâ€™t been myself lately and I really am sorry for the times na you took the fall with me when I stooped too low (on the bright side, it happened two times lang this month which is a  h u g e  improvement from before). To be honest, I donâ€™t even know who I am anymore. Itâ€™s like I have this new identity pero it also feels like Iâ€™m still me. And I know you somewhat noticed or at least sensed it too.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I want to say sorry din for not meeting your expectations siguro and sorry din cus compared to before and like you said, Iâ€™m not your safe and stress free zone anymore which is what something you do not deserve. Please know na I really am still doing my best and doing everything I can in all the ways that I can. Nonetheless, thank you for choosing me kahit di na ako safe space or the best. Iâ€™ll do everything I can to get back there.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        hayâ€” when weâ€™re apart, I want time to speed up na; but when weâ€™re together, I want it to slow down so I can keep up and live and savor the moment.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I may not be able to always fully heal you in your dark and heavy days; but rest assured, I will be by your side as you and I reach the afterglow, your afterglow, together.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        realized na me our relationship/ me choosing you, loving you, and choosing to love you and you alone is like my fascination and love for science/ astronomy. I know there are scary areas and depths, but I also know there are more beautiful things to uncover, discover, and admire within you and our relationship.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you for growing with me, love. It lowkey caught me off guard when I took a look at how much weâ€™ve been doing for each other ever since [always] talking things out and how much closer you are to me level na and I really am proud of you and thankful for you. Thank you for doing your best always. Thank you for always doing everything you can, in all the ways you can, and on your own pace. Iâ€™m so proud of you, my love. Keep going lang because you are doing so well and so great. Your baby pretty boy is very much satisfied and is getting everything he needs, wants, and deserves, and  m o r e.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you, my forever valentine.
                        <br>
                        I love you so much, Marylle Reese Planas Rabina.
                        <br>
                        You will always be appreciated, valued, cared for, valid, and loved, especially by me, your Achilles Vonn.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you for always being the best.
                        <br>
                        Like I always say; your pretty boy is, and will always be waiting for you. Always.
                        <br>
                        I promise to be with you at all the times that I can.
                        <br>
                        I promise Iâ€™ll never leave you. We are not getting spaced, breaking up, or separating.
                        <br>
                        â€™til death do us part, my love.
                        <br>
