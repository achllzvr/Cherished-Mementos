                        I know March has been a crazy fun month for the both of us despite the rocky beginning. Halfway through our first ever year together and we‚Äôve been nothing but a great couple.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Yes, my life specifically is already okay and cool and beautiful as it is. But you were the light that made me see it all. Before you, I had to light up the way ahead of me. When you came in, everything just started falling into place like it was already there for me to indulge and I just haven‚Äôt seen it yet. Like the moonlight shining on the ocean, I wouldn‚Äôt see the beauty and hope in my life if you didn‚Äôt come and lit it up for me.
                        <br>
                        <br>
Thank you for making my life less depressing. Going back to my apartment was always something I considered sad but with you waiting on the other end, it tones it down and you give me a reason to not be sad about my situation here in college because you always give me something to go back to and look forward to.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Again, I want to apologize lang uli for the events that occured when the month was just starting. I meant every word I said and I am doing my best not only to make it up to you, but to also make it up to myself for failing the both of us. I love you, my Mareese, you lang. I won‚Äôt ever replace you. I won‚Äôt leave you. I won‚Äôt have someone else because it is you who I want. I promise you, you‚Äôre the one I chose and you are the one I will continue to choose for the rest of this lifetime, and wherever we may go after. I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today without you, my love. I owe you a lot and I hope you know na you deserve the world, if not, everything that exists. You deserve so much and I will continue to do my best to give you everything I can with what I can do with the time I am given.
                        <br>
                        <br>
I appreciate you a lot, my love. Your efforts and everything you do for me and for us are always felt and seen. I really am very lucky to have you in my life, by my side. Thank you for always doing your best, for always trying, for always doing what you can for us, for me.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It was really fun being with you for one whole month, love. I enjoyed every second of every day. From taking care of you sa Ace, to aiding you in your recovery, to going to your house just cause, our dates, movie dates, with Kim date, our monthsary cook date, and everything else that happened within March was one crazy fun and very bitin experience. I wouldn‚Äôt have had it in any other way. Mwah.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I want to say thank you lang din for being the ate/ sibling that I could never be and the ‚Äúmom‚Äù kay Kim. Words can‚Äôt express how much it means to me na you two are very close and that he is very fond and cares for you rin. I love you and I‚Äôm sure he loves you too. Thank you for always helping Kim when you have the capability to do so. And thank you and I love the trio date we had with Kim sa SM because it was a good us three bond time and also a great bro time for me and a great child time for you. I know you enjoyed a lot that day din.

                        <br>
                        haha‚Ä¶ I also want to acknowledge your ‚Äú6PM‚Äù drive. I may not say it much but I am pretty sure my body shows it palagi, I enjoy every second of us doing what we do. Thank you for letting the both of us experience a more connecting and intimate way of expressing our love for each other. I want you to know na intimacy and connection is a big part of reassurance on my end so when we do what we do, I really mean it when I say na I love you and I want to feel you, in more ways than one. I‚Äôll continue to do my best to make you feel good din, in all the ways that I can, kahit di mo na kaya (iykyküòö).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You‚Äôll always have me, my love. I won‚Äôt go anywhere you can‚Äôt follow.
                        <br>
                        <br>
Love for me is a verb, not a noun. And loving you is a blessing and a choice, never an obligation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you for growing, my love. Words can‚Äôt express how grateful and happy I am that you, my girlfriend, my only exception, the love of my life, is willing to grow with me in all the ways we can. I am very lucky to have you, you specifically, my love. No one could ever get to your level in terms of everything you do for yourself, for me, for us, and for everyone around you. Your attempts and successes on trying and doing your best is always seen, heard, and very much appreciated. You trying and always doing your best with what you can alone is always something I admire and am thankful for.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I love you, Mareese. I always will. Even on the days you feel like you don‚Äôt deserve love. Even on the days you think you don‚Äôt deserve me. Even on your lowest days. Even on my bad days. Even on my lowest days. Even on the days when you can‚Äôt love yourself. I will love you, Mareese, no matter the sitiuation or circumstance.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Your pretty is and will always be here loving you. Mwah. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
