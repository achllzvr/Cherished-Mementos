                Hi, my lovee.
                <br>
                This month was really challenging. It was for you too. This month tested my patience and understanding towards everyone, even though not every single one of them deserved it. Thank you for being deserving of it. This month gave me a lot of mental challenges that reminded me of my past challenges but these ones are new. These ones are the hardest I’ve been through in terms of patience. I’ve let things pass because I was patient and I understood even though I wasn’t really okay with them happening to me.
                <br><br><br>
                Before anything else, let me just say these lang.
                <br><br><br>
                I’m sorry for all of the times I’ve broken your heart and hurt you. For all the times na your patience drained out because of me. For all the times I triggered and contributed to your sadness and heaviness. Please don’t hide your sorrows and everything else because I’d want you to share them with me.
                <br><br><br>
                Love, I know you’re tired na. I’m sorry this is what you got for your first, but I hope you hold on and I want you to know na I’m still doing my best to be your last :( . I hope you continue to hold on despite it being hard. Please hold on lang. Hold on to our plans and dreams, to me :( . I just need you to hold on despite everything hardship we’ll go through for everything to work out for the two of us. 
                <br><br><br>
                I promise I’m still doing my best to be the one you deserve. I’ll always try. I am and I will continue to do what I can with what I have. Please continue to be patient with me :( .
                <br><br><br>
                Thank you for always doing the same. Doing your best with what you can. For always trying too. Your efforts are seen and I am proud of you for growing. Thank you for growing with me, my love.
                <br><br><br>
                Thank you for doing your best at being patient and thank you for understanding. I know life gets hard but that’s where we grow and show to prove na we really do have good hearts despite living in one hell of a world. I hope you continue to be and add more to you being the only hope in the world by adding more understanding and patience that doesn’t just apply to me but to everyone else, so everything else bothers you less din.
                <br><br><br>
                Aligned with what I said above, I do hope you do and keep your promise wherein we agreed or you agreed na you’d let your heart decide what you want and throw away everything else, every influence, and start doing what you want to do and not let others’ opinion, influence, and comments enclose you in a shell. This is the promise that would literally change your life and the way you perceive things. Let your heart do everything. I’m saying this because I know you have a good heart, my only hope in the world. I know na you know you’re an angel like me rin that was in many ways hurt and mistreated but look where I am now when I let my heart do everything despite the hurt and mistreatment that came, continues to come, and will come. You’re my only hope in the world and I hope that doesn’t change. You have a good heart, my Mareese. I know you’re scared of getting hurt and mistreated by everyone else but like I said nung monthsary and the point we both agreed on, we did good and we did what we know what was morally correct and right and if they do something bad towards us, that’s their loss and their sin, not ours, so let’s do good things despite the possible hurt and mistreatment we’ll get, yes, together. 
                <br><br><br>
                Thank you for being patient and thank you for always trying and for always wanting to improve. You’ll always have someone waiting for you, my love. You’ll always have someone with you, me. Thank you rin for always making me the happiest in all the ways that you can. Thank you for being worthy of my love. Please remember din na now matter how many physical pains and hindrances you’ll get, I’ll still love you. I am and I will still be patient with you. Don’t ever think na my love for you will deplete/ lessen/ go out totally just because you’re experiencing physical pains. It will be hard, especially for you that’s for sure, but we’re strong, we always were and we still are and we will continue to be strong. I just hope the world would be less harsh on you, on us. There will be times, inevitable times na life gets hard, but like you said in one of my favorite vms, we just have to learn to accept them for us to grow. My very smart, emotionally and life smart baby.
                <br><br><br>
                I see your improvements, love. I appreciate them a lot, a lot lot. I’m sorry cus I feel like I don’t show gratitude for them much but I want you to know na I see and feel the growth you continue to live on and I am and I always will be watching you grow, by your side, and I will always be proud of you, my Mareese. Thank you for always sending cutie patootie pictures of you whenever you can. Thank you for always wanting to improve with me. Thank you for always wanting to talk things out whenever there is a problem. Thank you for being stubborn especially in times of need. Thank you for the compromises you’ve offered for me and our relationship. Thank you for always giving me time. Thank you for being patient with me. Thank you for always making me feel like I have a home. Thank you for always doing your best with what you can and what you have. Thank you for improving on showing your face, your very very pretty and cute face pag may camera and especially when the camera is from me. Thank you for growing and taking a lot of pics for me and for your growth and in your words, to battle your insecurities din. Thank you for always spoiling me whenever you can, especially with hugs and kisses whenever I’m physically there. Thank you for the wonderful and memorable cotillion experience. Sure, there were times na you were close at snapping at me, I still had fun and it’s fun to be in a school like activity with you especially cus we weren’t able to be in one together. Thank you for improving in your confidence side, I really am happy and proud na you are becoming more open to the outside world in terms of letting yourself out and not caring of what others would possibly think or say. It’s OUR world, we run it, not them, okay? Thank you for spoiling me with pics din whenever you cannnn, especially the recent ones hehe, I appreciate them a lot. Thank you for always being proton and doing your best to stay proton. Thank you for being strong despite the pagod we all feel everyday, you’re really strong, love, I hope you see thattt. Thank you for always creating the best memories with me. Thank you for being the one. Thank you for being my inspiration. Thank you for being my only exception, always. Thank you for being mine. Thank you for asking me kay God thus making me your answered prayer. Thank you for being always there in the ways that you can in the moment. Thank you for always doing your best in pulling me up even though internal/ me na talaga ang problem sometimes kaya it gets hard to pull me up again. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for being worthy of my love. Thank you for being you, Marylle. Thank you ‘cause you are you, my Mareese. Thank you for having a good heart, like me. And one of my favorites, thank you for always including me in your plans :(.

                <br><br><br>
                This month was filled with many great memories na I’m sure we’ll look back on in many cases in the future and I’m glad na I experienced them all with you, my love, my baby. Along with creating memories, we learned a lot of lessons din, mostly me, and I’m glad I could get to know you even more and I’m glad na we could learn from each other more and more and discover new things together. 
                <br><br><br>
                I love you, my Mareese. More than what my words right now could ever express.
