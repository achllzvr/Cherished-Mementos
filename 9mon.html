                        Hi, love. Mwah.
                        <br>
                        Before anything else, I want to get these out of the way na. I’m sorry for the past few weeks of me not being the person I promised I said I’d be/ I am. Everything was weighing me down and even I myself couldn’t pick myself back up easily na and I know it was dragging you and us down, I’m sorry. I’ll do better.
                        <br><br><br>
                        I’m proud of you, my love. Congratulations on finally graduating and somewhat finishing up your pre-college life. Your hardwork was and is seen and felt. You didn’t and you will never deserve the treatment you got from them back there, it will get better. Trust me, love. It will get better for you. I feel like it already is naman na rin. Mwah. Let’s trust God’s plan for this new chapter of your (our) life. We may not get what we wanted and deserve sometimes but ig it’s God moving pieces for us because He always knows what’s best and what will work for us as individuals and as partners.
                        <br><br><br>
                        Thank you for everything, love. Idk if I show my gratitude much still but I appreciate you a lot. The way you be patient with me, understand me, care for me, love me, do me favors, give me unconditional and natural love and affection is always appreciated and felt, I love you. Thank you for being mine. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for being the wonderful good hearted person you are. I hope you continue to be that good hearted person you are and improve upon it even more too.
                        <br><br><br>
                        Thank you for growing with me. Thank you for being stronger as the day passes. I can see how you fight everything that has been going on with you. Thank you for doing what you can with what you were given. Because I know na if you could, you would. Thank you for learning and becoming a wiser person each day. Your decisions and choices improved and I can see how much you’ve matured and grown for the past 9 months of being together; I’m proud of you.
                        <br><br><br>
                        “Thank you for showing your love through him.” “I’d rather be sad with you than happy with anyone else.”
                        The sweetest words I have ever heard. Words really can’t express how lucky and loved I feel because I’m with you and you chose me. I really am thankful, love. I love you so much. I am and I will continue to do my best to be the best version of me for you.
                        <br><br><br>
                        I love you beyond the starts, my Mareese. I love you and I will choose you, always and forever. I will be with you, to infinity and beyond. That’s all because you are a wonderful good hearted person. Because you are you. Not even AU can measure how blessed I am to be given the chance to be with you, you specifically.
                        <br><br>
                        To my Mareese, everything’s okay. You don’t have to be worried about anything at all anymore. If ever something’s wrong, there’s always the good ending, especially for us. Everything goes our way eventually. So let’s just sit tight and be patient and let God do His thing. Everything is okay. You are okay. You are good enough, you always were, and you always will be more than just “good enough”. You’re doing great, my love. Keep on fighting and living. You have a great life; We have a great life. And it’s time to be happy and carefree with our lives, especially because we have each other to support the other.
                        <br>
                        I’m here, and I always will be.
                        <br><br><br>
                        I love you, my pretty baby bilog.
                        <br><br><br>
                        Mwah.
